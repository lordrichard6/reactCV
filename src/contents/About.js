                Oi, first of all welcome to cv react page, i came from Portugal long time ago searching for ambition,<br/>
                tried some jobs but none gave me pleasure in the long haul,<br/>
                then i found web development and discover that i really like to build stuff that could be used by millions... <br/> 
                Long story short i don't have a Computer Science degree but i can learn whatever language,<br/>
                or framework that is in my way to become a successfull developer. <br/>
                I'm fluent in portuguese(really!), aswell as in English, pretty good with Spanish and not bad with German,<br/>
                the last one has giving me a bit of headache but i will eventually get there. 
                </p>
